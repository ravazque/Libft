# Libft
This is the first project of the cursus in school 42, the objective is to create a library with replicated or self-made functions to make use of them in our future projects.

It is divided in two parts, functions replicated from the **libc** *(23)* and other **additional functions** *(11)*. To this is added a *bonus part* where we will start to handle and see the use of **linked lists** *(10)*.
  
 ‎ 
In these functions we will use and learn from:

- **Basic functions** ➜
>**atoi, strlen, strcpy,** etc... These are some examples of functions to replicate.

- **Dynamic memory** ➜
>**Malloc** & **Free**, we will use these functions to make, for example, **ft_bzero** and **ft_calloc**.

- **Creation and use of *own* libraries** ➜
>Example: **#include “libft.h"**

- **Makefiles** ➜
> Set rules for compiling a program: | **$(NAME)** | **all** | **clean** | **fclean** | **fclean** |


> [!NOTE]
>In this case, our makefile should avoid making **relink**: *Compile again without having generated changes in the already compiled functions.*

----
> [!WARNING]
> In this repository **there will be functions that do not belong to the 43 original libft functions**, these have been added in the future in order to be used for other projects or are properly projects like **ft_printf**.
